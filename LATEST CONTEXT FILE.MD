# YieldSwarm Project - Latest Context

## What I'm Trying to Build (Project Overview)
YieldSwarm is a multi-chain DeFi yield optimizer that leverages agent and swarm intelligence. It integrates a Julia backend for complex simulations and optimizations (like portfolio optimization) and a Node.js backend for orchestration, a REST API, and UI serving. The goal is to autonomously discover, analyze, and execute optimal yield farming strategies across various blockchain networks.

## What I've Accomplished (Accomplishments)
Based on the `TODO.md` and our recent work:
*   **JuliaOS SDK Integration:** The official JuliaOS SDK has been integrated, and the `JuliaOSMock.ts` file has been removed.
*   **Test Suite:** A test suite has been initiated, and unit tests for `YieldCalculator.ts` and `RiskAgent.test.ts` have been created and are passing. The `SwarmCoordinator.test.ts` integration test has also been updated and is passing.
*   **CLI Enhancements:** An `alerts` command has been added to the CLI to display recent risk alerts. The CLI also supports listing/managing agents and swarms, and showing yield opportunities.
*   **UI Mock Data Feature:** A `/mock-opportunities` endpoint has been added to the backend API to allow users to paste JSON data for mock `YieldOpportunity` objects, which are then broadcasted through the `SwarmCoordinator`.
*   **Code Cleanup (Partial):** Initial steps have been taken to remove unnecessary `console.log` and `console.debug` statements from `src/defi/RealDEXIntegrations.ts` and `backend/CustomJuliaBridge.ts`.
*   **Compilation Errors Resolved:** All `TS7030: Not all code paths return a value` errors in `backend/api.ts` have been resolved by explicitly adding `return` statements where necessary. The project now builds successfully.
*   **Code Cleanup (Continued)::** Removed `[DEBUG]` prefixes from logger statements in `src/defi/RealDEXIntegrations.ts` and added comprehensive comments to API endpoints in `backend/api.ts`.
*   **Inter-Agent Communication Fixed:** Refactored `SwarmCoordinator` and `AgentCommunication` to correctly route messages between agents, ensuring portfolio allocation and risk alerts are processed as expected. This involved: 
    *   Updating `src/types/index.ts` with new `MessageType` enums for Julia events.
    *   Modifying `src/swarm/SwarmCoordinator.ts` to use `AgentCommunication` for internal agent-to-agent messaging and to correctly emit messages to the UI.
    *   Modifying `backend/api.ts` to correctly register `AnalysisAgent` and `RiskAgent` with `AgentCommunication` using fixed IDs.
    *   Modifying `src/agents/DiscoveryAgent.ts` and `src/agents/AnalysisAgent.ts` to use `sendToAgent` for targeted messages.
    *   Removing unused `message` variables in `src/agents/DiscoveryAgent.ts` and `src/agents/RiskAgent.ts`.
    *   Updating `IAgentCommunication` interface in `src/swarm/SwarmCoordinator.ts` to include `sendToAgent`.
*   **UI Fix:** Resolved `TypeError: agentChainSelect is null` in `app.js` by adding the missing `agent-chain-container` div to `index.html` and conditionally including the `chain` property in agent creation data. Also removed the `required` attribute from `agent-chain` and `agent-type` in `index.html` and added programmatic validation in `app.js` for `agent-type`.
*   **Julia Backend Refactoring:** Simplified `src/julia/agents.jl` and `src/julia/swarms.jl` by removing internal data processing and reliance on `ANALYZED_OPPORTUNITIES`. The Julia backend now primarily serves as a computation engine for portfolio optimization, triggered by the Node.js `YieldCalculator`. Removed unused methods from `src/defi/YieldCalculator.ts`.
*   **Data Type Conversion Fix:** Added explicit type conversions in Julia's `portfolio_optimizer.jl` to ensure correct numeric types (`Float64`) are used for optimization parameters.
*   **Julia Syntax Fix:** Removed an extra `end` keyword in `portfolio_optimizer.jl` that was causing a syntax error.

## What I'm About to Do (Next Steps)
My immediate focus is to continue with the general code cleanup, focusing on consistent formatting and style, and adding comments where necessary. I will also look into adding more comprehensive unit and integration tests.

## Problems I'm Facing (Current Problems)
All known compilation errors have been resolved, and the project builds successfully. Inter-agent communication for portfolio allocation and risk alerts has been restored. The UI errors have been fixed. There are no immediate blocking problems.
