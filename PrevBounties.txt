About JuliaOS

JuliaOS is a modular, open-source platform for building, deploying, and managing AI-powered agents and swarms across multiple blockchains. It combines the performance of Julia (a high-speed, AI-native language) with a flexible dev stack (Node.js CLI, Python bindings) and a robust onchain/offchain agent framework. For non-technical users, JuliaOS also offers a no-code dApp builder with the same AI and swarm capabilities in a simple, intuitive interface. You can learn more about us on our X page: [x.com/buildonjulia](https://x.com/buildonjulia).
üéØ Mission

JuliaOS supports a wide range of intelligent agents that can reason, plan, and act across decentralized systems. The goal of this bounty is to showcase creative, powerful, or novel agents built using JuliaOS primitives ‚Äî especially those that can interact with real-world data, coordinate with swarms, or integrate with blockchain environments.
üîç Scope Detail

Your task is to create one or more intelligent agents that showcase advanced capabilities made possible by the JuliaOS framework. You are encouraged to focus on areas such as:

    LLM-enabled agents that use agent.useLLM() to reason about tasks or data
    Swarm-coordinating agents that lead or manage other agents in a dynamic environment
    Tool-using agents that call external APIs, contracts, or JuliaOS extensions
    Composable agents designed to plug into future dApps or infrastructure

Bonus points for agents that tackle use cases in:

    DeFi strategy or portfolio management
    NFT valuation or generative content
    Data labeling or web scraping
    Crypto research, contract auditing, or DAO tooling

‚úÖ Submission Requirements

How to Participate:

    Clone or fork the [JuliaOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/Juliaoscode) if needed.
    Create your agent code in a separate public GitHub repository with:
        Clear instructions on how to run and test it
        A description of what the agent does and how it uses JuliaOS
        Any demo video or screenshots (optional but recommended)
    Submit your work by:
        Filling out the submission form on the bounty platform
        Or submitting this form with your github repo link.

Development Guidelines:

    Code must comply with the MIT License
    Follow JuliaOS best practices for agent design (see Docs)
    Clearly separate agent logic from JuliaOS system code (unless contributing upstream)
    Include minimal tests or usage examples to demonstrate functionality

üèÜ Judging Criteria

    Functionality ‚Äì Does the agent perform its task effectively?
    JuliaOS Integration ‚Äì Does it showcase native JuliaOS capabilities (e.g., agent.run, useLLM, swarm composition)?
    Creativity ‚Äì Is the agent solving a unique or complex problem?
    Code Quality ‚Äì Is the code readable, well-structured, and maintainable?
    Documentation ‚Äì Is there a clear explanation of how to use and extend the agent?
