About JuliaOS

JuliaOS is a modular, open-source platform for building, deploying, and managing AI-powered agents and swarms across multiple blockchains. It combines the performance of Julia (a high-speed, AI-native language) with a flexible dev stack (Node.js CLI, Python bindings) and a robust onchain/offchain agent framework. For non-technical users, JuliaOS also offers a no-code dApp builder with the same AI and swarm capabilities in a simple, intuitive interface. You can learn more about us on our X page.
üéØ Mission

The mission of this bounty is to build fully functional decentralized application powered by the JuliaOS framework. The goal is to demonstrate the versatility of JuliaOS through real-world applications that leverage AI agents, swarm orchestration, or multi-chain deployment. Successful submissions will showcase how developers can use JuliaOS to quickly build performant, intelligent dApps onchain and offchain.
üîç Scope Detail

Required:

    JuliaOS Agent Execution
    Implement autonomous or LLM-powered agents using agent.useLLM() or equivalent API calls provided in the JuliaOS Gitbook.

Optional Features (bonus points):

    Swarm Integration
    Use JuliaOS swarm APIs to coordinate and manage multiple agents working together.

    Onchain Functionality
    Interact with Solana smart contracts or execute onchain queries through JuliaOS‚Äôs onchain interfaces.

    UI/UX Layer
    You may build a custom front-end using using your own UI stack. This is encouraged if you‚Äôre building a more advanced or highly customized user experience.


Simplified Agent Use Case examples:

    Cross-Chain Arbitrage Swarm Bot. A swarm of AI agents that collaborate to find and exploit arbitrage opportunities across multiple exchanges.

    Web3 Gaming Companion. An AI assistant tailored for blockchain gamers that helps manage in-game crypto assets and improve gameplay strategies.

    AI DAO Governance Advisor. An AI agent that helps DAOs by analyzing proposals, summarizing discussions, and forecasting potential outcomes.

    Web3 Project Research Assistant. An AI agent that automates due diligence and research on blockchain projects

    On-Chain Transaction Trace & Compliance Agent. An AI assistant that reconstructs and visualizes the full path of suspicious transactions across multiple blockchains‚Äîfrom the origin of stolen funds through mixers, bridges, and wallets‚Äîto the current holder.
